ConnectionBundle
================

Implementation of a directed Graph for establishing connections between objects.

For instance, a connection may represent:
* follower/following relationship between two users on a social network
* an user "following" a "tag"
* in fact, any relation between any root objects which need to be connected for any reason ;-)

The purpose of this bundle is not to get a ready-to-use implementation but at the minimum a code base to ease the integration of such a system in a Symfony 2 application.
